# SIBot
You might ask, "What is this, and what does the SI stand for?". To answer that watch [this video](https://youtu.be/sAn7baRbhx4)

# Oh, very funny but what is it?
Well, it is a simple Discord bot written in Python using the Discord.py (rewrite branch) library.
 
## But what does it do?
Well... what it mainly does is 'scare' people in a voice channel, by playing a sound (preferably loud) and then leaving the channel.
By the name and the video I linked to at the start it is obvious what it is supposed to play. But you can easily put another sound in the
bot's folder (just have it be named scare.mp3).

## Can I use it for myself?
Of course, but it would be nice if you'd add/keep at least **something** that alludes to the original creator (ie. *me*).
